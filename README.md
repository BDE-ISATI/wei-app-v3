# WEI Webapp v2

For past ESIR WEIs (Integration Week End) we used to have an android app that could be used to do challenges that would grand points, and then see a leaderboard that would rank every student based on how much points they have. Unfortunately this app wasn't on iOS, which made the app not usable for iPhone users (a lot of students).

This is the developpement branch for the more stable, more secured and more efficient wei app version 2, used by ISATI at the ESIR Engineering school.

This version is meant to be the final version of an app used specifically for limited time events based on challenges.

To be used with [WEI Webapp](https://github.com/BDE-ISATI/wei_app_server) version 2, currently being developped.
