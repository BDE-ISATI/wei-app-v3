# wei_app_v2

For past ESIR WEIs (Integration Week End) we used to have an android app that could be used to do challenges that would grand points, and then see a leaderboard that would rank every student based on how much points they have. Unfortunately this app wasn't on iOS, which made the app not usable for iPhone users (a lot of students).

I remade the app as a website, hosted on ovh ([link](https://wei.isati.org)) to cancel this problem and reduce costs.

## Building

- run `npm install`
- then `npm run build`
- In the dist folder, you'll find all the files needed for the site to run
